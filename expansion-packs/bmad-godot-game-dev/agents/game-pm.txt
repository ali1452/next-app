# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-godot-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-godot-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-godot-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-godot-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:

# Game Development Change Navigation Checklist (Godot)

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the Game SM agent and user through analysis and planning when a significant change (performance issue, platform constraint, technical blocker, gameplay feedback) is identified during Godot game development.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - GAME CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes during game development are common - performance issues, platform constraints, gameplay feedback, and technical limitations are part of the process.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes affecting game architecture or features
2. Minor tweaks (shader adjustments, UI positioning) don't require this process
3. The goal is to maintain playability while adapting to technical realities
4. Performance (60+ FPS) and player experience are paramount
5. Consider both GDScript and C# implementation options

Required context:

- The triggering issue (performance metrics, crash logs, feedback)
- Current development state (implemented features, current sprint)
- Access to GDD, technical specs, and performance budgets
- Understanding of remaining features and milestones
- Current language usage (GDScript vs C#) per system

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process. Discuss performance implications, platform constraints, and player impact. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert Godot/game dev guidance.

REMEMBER: Game development is iterative. Changes often lead to better gameplay and performance.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by understanding the game-specific issue. Ask technical questions:

- What performance metrics triggered this? (FPS, frame time, memory)
- Is this platform-specific or universal?
- Can we reproduce it consistently?
- What Godot profiler data do we have?
- Is this a GDScript performance issue that C# could solve?
- Are we hitting Godot engine limits?

Focus on measurable impacts and technical specifics.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Element:** Clearly identify the game feature/system revealing the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Performance bottleneck (CPU/GPU/Memory)?
  - [ ] Draw call or batching issue?
  - [ ] Platform-specific limitation?
  - [ ] Godot engine constraint?
  - [ ] GDScript vs C# performance difference?
  - [ ] Node tree complexity issue?
  - [ ] Signal overhead problem?
  - [ ] Physics engine bottleneck?
  - [ ] Gameplay/balance issue from playtesting?
  - [ ] Asset import or resource loading problem?
  - [ ] Export template or platform issue?
- [ ] **Assess Performance Impact:** Document specific metrics (current FPS, target 60+ FPS, frame time ms, draw calls, memory usage).
- [ ] **Gather Technical Evidence:** Note Godot profiler data, performance monitor stats, platform test results, player feedback.

## 2. Game Feature Impact Assessment

[[LLM: Game features are interconnected in Godot's node system. Evaluate systematically:

1. Can we optimize the current feature without changing gameplay?
2. Should this system move from GDScript to C#?
3. Do dependent scenes/nodes need adjustment?
4. Are there Godot-specific optimizations available?
5. Does this affect our performance budget allocation?

Consider both technical and gameplay impacts.]]

- [ ] **Analyze Current Sprint Features:**
  - [ ] Can the current feature be optimized?
    - [ ] Object pooling for frequently instantiated nodes?
    - [ ] LOD system implementation?
    - [ ] Draw call batching improvements?
    - [ ] Move hot code from GDScript to C#?
    - [ ] Static typing in GDScript for performance?
  - [ ] Does it need gameplay simplification?
  - [ ] Should it be platform-specific (high-end only)?
- [ ] **Analyze Dependent Systems:**
  - [ ] Review all scenes and nodes interacting with the affected feature.
  - [ ] Do physics bodies need optimization?
  - [ ] Are Control nodes/UI systems impacted?
  - [ ] Do Resource save/load systems require changes?
  - [ ] Are multiplayer RPCs affected?
  - [ ] Do signal connections need optimization?
- [ ] **Language Migration Assessment:**
  - [ ] Would moving this system to C# improve performance?
  - [ ] What's the interop overhead if we split languages?
  - [ ] Can we maintain rapid iteration with C#?
- [ ] **Summarize Feature Impact:** Document effects on node hierarchy, scene structure, and technical architecture.

## 3. Game Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Game documentation drives development. Check each artifact:

1. Does this invalidate GDD mechanics?
2. Are technical architecture assumptions still valid?
3. Do performance budgets need reallocation?
4. Are platform requirements still achievable?
5. Does our language strategy (GDScript/C#) need revision?

Missing conflicts cause performance issues later.]]

- [ ] **Review GDD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with core gameplay mechanics?
  - [ ] Do game features need scaling for performance?
  - [ ] Are progression systems affected?
  - [ ] Do balance parameters need adjustment?
- [ ] **Review Technical Architecture:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with Godot architecture (scene structure, node hierarchy)?
  - [ ] Are autoload/singleton systems impacted?
  - [ ] Do shader/rendering approaches need revision?
  - [ ] Are Resource structures optimal for the scale?
  - [ ] Is the GDScript/C# split still appropriate?
- [ ] **Review Performance Specifications:**
  - [ ] Are target framerates (60+ FPS) still achievable?
  - [ ] Do memory budgets need reallocation?
  - [ ] Are load time targets realistic?
  - [ ] Do we need platform-specific targets?
  - [ ] Are draw call budgets exceeded?
- [ ] **Review Asset Specifications:**
  - [ ] Do texture import settings need adjustment?
  - [ ] Are mesh instance counts appropriate?
  - [ ] Do audio bus configurations need changes?
  - [ ] Is the animation tree complexity sustainable?
  - [ ] Are particle system limits appropriate?
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all game documents requiring updates.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present Godot-specific solutions with technical trade-offs:

1. What's the performance gain (FPS improvement)?
2. How much rework is required?
3. What's the player experience impact?
4. Are there platform-specific solutions?
5. Should we migrate systems from GDScript to C#?
6. Can we leverage Godot 4.x features if on 3.x?

Be specific about Godot implementation details.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Optimization Within Current Design:**
  - [ ] Can performance be improved through Godot optimizations?
    - [ ] Object pooling with node reuse?
    - [ ] MultiMesh for instancing?
    - [ ] Viewport optimization?
    - [ ] Occlusion culling setup?
    - [ ] Static typing in GDScript?
    - [ ] Batch draw calls with CanvasItem?
    - [ ] Optimize signal connections?
    - [ ] Reduce node tree depth?
  - [ ] Define specific optimization techniques.
  - [ ] Estimate performance improvement potential.
- [ ] **Option 2: Language Migration:**
  - [ ] Would moving to C# provide needed performance?
  - [ ] Identify hot paths for C# conversion.
  - [ ] Define interop boundaries.
  - [ ] Assess development velocity impact.
- [ ] **Option 3: Feature Scaling/Simplification:**
  - [ ] Can the feature be simplified while maintaining fun?
  - [ ] Identify specific elements to scale down.
  - [ ] Define platform-specific variations.
  - [ ] Assess player experience impact.
- [ ] **Option 4: Architecture Refactor:**
  - [ ] Would restructuring improve performance significantly?
  - [ ] Identify Godot-specific refactoring needs:
    - [ ] Scene composition changes?
    - [ ] Node hierarchy optimization?
    - [ ] Signal system redesign?
    - [ ] Autoload restructuring?
    - [ ] Resource management improvements?
  - [ ] Estimate development effort.
- [ ] **Option 5: Scope Adjustment:**
  - [ ] Can we defer features to post-launch?
  - [ ] Should certain features be platform-exclusive?
  - [ ] Do we need to adjust milestone deliverables?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Choose based on performance gain vs. effort.

## 5. Game Development Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must include technical specifics:

1. Performance metrics (before/after projections with FPS targets)
2. Godot implementation details (nodes, scenes, scripts)
3. Language strategy (GDScript vs C# per system)
4. Platform-specific considerations
5. Testing requirements (GUT for GDScript, GoDotTest for C#)
6. Risk mitigation strategies

Make it actionable for game developers.]]

(Ensure all points from previous sections are captured)

- [ ] **Technical Issue Summary:** Performance/technical problem with metrics.

- [ ] **Updated Game Stories:** Revised stories with technical constraints.

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Game changes require technical validation. Before concluding:

1. Are performance targets (60+ FPS) clearly defined?
2. Is the Godot implementation approach clear?
3. Is the language strategy (GDScript/C#) documented?
4. Do we have rollback strategies?
5. Are test scenarios defined for both languages?
6. Is platform testing covered?

Get explicit approval on technical approach.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-godot-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-godot-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-godot-game-dev/config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-godot-game-dev/config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-godot-game-dev/config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

### Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` → create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:
   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### → ##
     - #### → ###
     - ##### → ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)

    title: Intro Project Analysis and Context
    instruction: |
      IMPORTANT - SCOPE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:

      This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing projects that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. Before proceeding:

      1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: If this is a simple feature addition or bug fix that could be completed in 1-2 focused development sessions, STOP and recommend: "For simpler changes, consider using the brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story task with the Product Owner instead. This full PRD process is designed for substantial enhancements that require architectural planning and multiple coordinated stories."

      2. **Project Context**: Determine if we're working in an IDE with the project already loaded or if the user needs to provide project information. If project files are available, analyze existing documentation in the docs folder. If insufficient documentation exists, recommend running the document-project task first.

      3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing project structure, patterns, and constraints before making ANY suggestions. Every recommendation must be grounded in actual project analysis, not assumptions.

      Gather comprehensive information about the existing project. This section must be completed before proceeding with requirements.

      CRITICAL: Throughout this analysis, explicitly confirm your understanding with the user. For every assumption you make about the existing project, ask: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"

      Do not proceed with any recommendations until the user has validated your understanding of the existing system.

      2. Ask user about: Godot version, 2D/3D, GDScript/C#, plugins/addons, target platforms, networking needs
      3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on game type and target platforms
      4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the game)
      5. These become constraints for development - be specific and complete
    elicit: true
    choices:
      godot_version: [Godot 4.4, Godot 4.3, Godot 3.x]
      architecture: [Single Player, Local Multiplayer, Online Multiplayer, MMO]
      testing: [Manual Playtesting, Automated Tests, Both]
    sections:
      - id: godot-version
        title: "Godot Version: {4.4|4.3|3.x}"
      - id: game-architecture
        title: Game Architecture
        instruction: "CRITICAL DECISION - Document the game architecture (e.g., Single Player, Local Co-op, Online PvP, Server-Authoritative Multiplayer, P2P)."
      - id: testing-requirements
        title: Testing & QA Requirements
        instruction: "CRITICAL DECISION - Document playtesting approach, automated testing needs (if any), performance profiling requirements, platform certification requirements."
      - id: additional-assumptions
        title: Additional Godot Technical Assumptions
        instruction: Throughout the entire process of drafting this document, if any other Godot-specific technical assumptions are raised (rendering pipeline, physics engine settings, audio system, input handling), add them here as additional bulleted items

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Systems: Setup Godot project, implement player controller, and basic game loop"
      - "Epic 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics: Implement primary game mechanics, combat/interaction systems"
      - "Epic 3: Level Design & Content: Create levels, enemies, and game progression"
      - "Epic 4: Polish & Game Feel: Add VFX, audio, juice, and game polish"
      - "Epic 5: Menus & Meta Systems: Implement save/load, settings, achievements"

  - id: epic-details
    title: Epic {{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}
    repeatable: true
    instruction: |
      After the epic list is approved, present each epic with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit.

      For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve).

      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

      - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
      - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
      - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
      - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
      - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
      - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
      - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
      - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
      - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice
    elicit: true

            instruction: |
              Define clear, comprehensive, and testable acceptance criteria that:

              - Precisely define what "done" means from a functional perspective
              - Are unambiguous and serve as basis for verification
              - Include any critical non-functional requirements from the PRD
              - Consider local testability for backend/data components
              - Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence where applicable
              - Avoid cross-cutting concerns that should be in other stories or PRD sections

  - id: checklist-results
    title: Checklist Results Report
    instruction: Before running the checklist and drafting the prompts, offer to output the full updated PRD. If outputting it, confirm with the user that you will be proceeding to run the checklist and produce the report. Once the user confirms, execute the pm-checklist and populate the results in this section.

  - id: next-steps
    title: Next Steps
    sections:
